== Project: ResidentBook
ResidentBook is a newly conceptualised administrative tool catered for staffs handling hostel and college operations. Universities such as NUS, has numerous hostels and colleges. Administrative staff has to handle all the matters regarding check in, check out , and ensuring
that all Residents have paid for their fees during their stay. However, while the school employs a system with database of Resident details, common administrative staff are unable to read the information due to policies such as PDPA.

Simple day to day operations can be carried out with minimal critical and private data. For example, Residents' NRIC is unnecessary when checking in, as the matriculation card is sufficient in proving his identity.

Also, while the University welcomes exchange students and guests during the semester, some data cannot be found in the school's database if the guests approaches the college or hall directly. The temporary person feature is implemented, where the details will be automatically deleted after the timing specified by the staff.
The feature also help to prevent storing redundant and unnecessary details in the ResidentBook. Additionally, for exchange students, the staff can easily import and export the details into the current ResidentBook.

Colleges and Halls are famous for their vibrant community life. CCAs, dance classes and interest groups are just some example of weekly events Residents can participate in. Administrators are required to keep a calendar of upcoming events when queries by Professors or Guests who are interested in the events.
However, with so many events happening every week, it will be hard to keep track without a calendar that shows the overview of events during the month. This also helps administrators in finding clashes of events.

Keeping these in mind, ResidentBook is developed to ease the overhead and trouble of handling hostel or college administration matters. Showing only necessary details such as Room number and Contact number, administrators are able to perform day-to-day operations.
ResidentBook uses Command line interface (CLI) as the primary source of input. Accompanied with features such as auto-complete, ResidenkBook aim to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of Hostel and College life.

A simple, clean and minimalist design is adopted for the GUI. One glance through the application will give staff the most vital details required for their daily operations.

=== Enhancement Added: Autocomplete

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=autocomplete]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

Since there are a multitude of commands available to the user, it is highly improbably that they would be able to remember
all the given commands. As such, it would be convenient to just remember partially the what the commands are and allow an
autocompleted list to generate the commands for them.

=== Enhancement Added: Highlight

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=highlight]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

Since there will be occasions when the Administrator of the Residence wants to select a specific group of individuals,
i.e. students who have yet to register for the next semester's housing, it would be convenient for them to be able to
view the group with respect to those that have registered, perhaps to judge the rough percentage of residents who have
registered.
