== Project: ResidentBook
ResidentBook is a newly conceptualised administrative tool catered for staffs handling hostel and college operations. Universities such as NUS, has numerous hostels and colleges. Administrative staff has to handle all the matters regarding check in, check out , and ensuring that all Residents have paid for their fees during their stay. However, while the school employs a system with database of Resident details, common administrative staff are unable to read the information due to policies such as PDPA.

Simple day to day operations can be carried out with minimal critical and private data. For example, Residents' NRIC is unnecessary when checking in, as the matriculation card is sufficient in proving his identity.

Also, while the University welcomes exchange students and guests during the semester, some data cannot be found in the schoolâ€™s database if the guests approaches the college or hall directly. The temporary person feature is implemented, where the details will be automatically deleted after the timing specified by the staff. The feature also help to prevent storing redundant and unnecessary details in the ResidentBook. Additionally, for exchange students, the staff can easily import and export the details into the current ResidentBook.

Colleges and Halls are famous for their vibrant community life. CCAs, dance classes and interest groups are just some example of weekly events Residents can participate in. Administrators are required to keep a calendar of upcoming events when queries by Professors or Guests who are interested in the events. However, with so many events happening every week, it will be hard to keep track without a calendar that shows the overview of events during the month. This also helps administrators in finding clashes of events.

Keeping these in mind, ResidentBook is developed to ease the overhead and trouble of handling hostel or college administration matters. Showing only necessary details such as Room number and Contact number, administrators are able to perform day-to-day operations. ResidentBook uses Command line interface (CLI) as the primary source of input. Accompanied with features such as auto-complete, ResidenkBook aim to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of Hostel and College life.

=== Enhancement Added: Temporary residents

==== Justification

Hostel managers often welcome visitors or guests that may not stay for the entire duration of the semester. Making a resident
 temporary would automatically allow ResidentBook to delete the resident's details after the preset time. This not only saves space
 in the ResidentBook, but also saves the hassle of looking through a long list of residents to find the guest to delete.

=== Enhancement Added: Add command deletebytag

#End of Extract#

==== Justification
Tags are useful when they are assigned to a person or a group of people for identification purpose.
When we want to remove all people who have been assigned a certain tag, this command comes in handy.

For example, at the start of the year, the hostel administrator added Y4 students and gave them the tag "graduating".
Now at the end of the year after they have graduated, the hostel administrator wants to remove all of them from the
ResidentBook. This command serves this purpose, and many more similar scenarios.

=== Enhancement Added: Add Calendar Interface and Commands

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=Calendar]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification
Since events management is a great feature of ResidentBook, it would be natural to add a calendar
to view the events. Furthermore with more events being added, viewing events in a list makes it hard to see the relative
dates that the events are taking place. This feature aims to solve that problem.
