=== Enhancement Added: Temporary residents

==== External behavior

#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=temporaryperson]

#End of Extract#

==== Justification

Hostel managers often welcome visitors or guests that may not stay for the entire duration of the semester. Making a resident
 temporary would automatically allow ResidentBook to delete the resident's details after the preset time. This not only saves space
 in the ResidentBook, but also saves the hassle of looking through a long list of residents to find the guest to delete.

==== Implementation

=== Enhancement Added: Add command deletebytag
